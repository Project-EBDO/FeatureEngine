## Overview

As said earlier, to add a WAV file, please follow this nomenclature:

1. Specify the type of signal generated in the file (sin, noise, ...)
2. Indicate the sampling rate of the signal
3. Provide the duration

## Example of file name

WAV file:
`sin_48kHz_10s`  -> type of signal: sinus; sampling rate: 48 kHz; duration: 10 seconds
