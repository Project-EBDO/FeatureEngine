## Overview

As said earlier, to add a text file, please follow this nomenclature:

1. Specify the type of signal generated in the file (sin, noise, ...)
2. Indicate the sampling rate of the signal
3. Provide the duration
4. Define which function was used
5. List parameters of the function

## Example of file name
