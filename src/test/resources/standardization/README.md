# Standardization resources organization

## Overview

This folder contains the ODE-FeatureEngine signal processing standardization tests reference values.
Sub-folders are as follow:

+ `sounds` contains the wav files
+ `matlab`
  + `scripts` - contains matlab scripts used to generate expected values from sounds.
  + `values` - contains matlab expected values generated by scripts on sounds.
+ `scipy`
  + `scripts` - contains scipy scripts used to generate expected values from sounds.
  + `values` - contains matlab expected values generated by scripts on sounds.

## Files conventions

### Sounds

Wav Files in the `sounds` folder should be encoded as `PCM Little-Endian` and named as follow:

```bash
SOUNDID_SYSBITS_WAVBITS_SAMPLENUMBER_SAMPRATE_CHANSNUMBER.wav
```

With:

+ `FILEID` - The sound identifier, unique among sounds
+ `SYSBITS` - The bytes number the file-writing system used (generally `64`, but could be `32`)
+ `WAVBITS` - The number of bits used for sound encoding (`8`, `16` or `24` generally)
+ `SAMPLENUMBER` - The number of samples in the sound file
+ `SAMPRATE` - The sampling rate the sound is using in Hz (usual values are `3900.0` `16000`, `44100`, `96000.0`...)
+ `CHANSNUNMBER` - The number of channels the file contains (`1` for mono, `2` for stereo etc)

### Expected values

Expected values in  `*/values` folders should be formatted using one line per time-result,
with space separated values, values written as floating-point numbers (float or double).
Complex values in the files follow this convention: complex number are represented by
two consecutive Double (i.e. `Re(z_0) Im(z_0) Re(R_1) Im(z_1) ... Im(z_n)`)

The file names should follow the convention:

```bash
SOUNDID_SYSBITS_WAVBITS_SAMPLENUMBER_SAMPRATE_CHANSNUMBER_ALGO_NFFT_WINSIZE_OVERLAP_VSYSBITS.txt
```

With:

+ `SOUNDID_SYSBITS_WAVBITS_SAMPLENUMBER_SAMPRATE_CHANSNUMBER` - The sound used to generate the data (see above for details)
+ `ALGO` - The algorithm used to generate the values (currently either `FFT` or `PSD`)
+ `NFFT` - The size of the FFT computation window in bytes
+ `WINSIZE` - The size of the signal window used in FFT in bytes
+ `OVERLAP` - The overlap of signal windows as ratio of `WINSIZE`
+ `VSYSBITS` - The bytes number the computation-system used (generally `64`, but could be `32`)
